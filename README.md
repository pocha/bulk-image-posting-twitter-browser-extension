- 🔒 The extension only works on twitter.com and x.com domains
- 📸 Only image files are accepted (PNG, JPG, GIF, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

**Extension doesn't post:**

- Make sure you're logged into Twitter
- Check that Twitter's UI hasn't changed (the extension relies on specific UI elements)
- Try manually creating a tweet to ensure Twitter is functioning normally

**Images don't appear:**

- Ensure the images are valid image files
- Check file size (Twitter has limits on image uploads)

**Posts are too fast:**

- Increase the delay value for each image
- Twitter may rate-limit rapid posting
